            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THis little Piece did I fore-cast to leave in a faithful hand for thee; that if God would, it might be some Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Support to thee after my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and adde some relief to thy drooping Spirit, having so newly parted from thy dear Husband: And though peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon the first cast of thine Eye over it, it may cause thy tender heart to relent the more, to hear thy dead Husband speaking to thee, as it were out of his Grave; yet I hope when thou hast well weighed the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the comfortable Arguments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contained; it may be no little comfort and refreshing to thy mind at present. And also if God will, it may be of good use to the remaining part of that little time that thou hast yet to live in this Vale of Tears.</p>
                  <p>Now the Lord add his Blessing to it, that it may do thee good. The Reason why I did not shew it unto thee in my life-time, was, Because I thought it might take so much the more impression upon thee for thy
<pb facs="tcp:152495:3"/>good and comfort, by how much the more it should come new and unexpected to thy hand, and that at such a time when thou never expectedst to bear any thing more of thy Husband in this World; that then he should as it were come again to thee, and afford thee one half hours discourse for thy comfort in this little Book. And for the occasion that put me upon it, thou mayst perceive that, in the Preface of that little Piece I have writ to my Children.</p>
                  <p>Dear Wife! I shall say no more: The Lord be ever with thee, and plant his fear more and more in thee; and replenish thy heart, and my Childrens, with his Grace, and the sweet Knowledge of Christ-Farewell, till I see thee again.</p>

                     <l>MY dearest Wife, and faithful Friend,</l>
                     <l>For thee (my Love) these Lines I write,</l>

                     <l>My face, not hear my tongue to speak,</l>
                     <l>Which doubtless will be sad to thee,</l>
                     <l>And make thy tender heart to break.</l>
                     <l>I here have left my tongue behind,</l>

                     <l>When upon earth my Glass is run.</l>
                     <l>Dear Heart! It wounds me most of all,</l>
                     <l>That thou shouldst grieve thy tender heart,</l>
                     <l>And drink down Wormwood mixt with Gall,</l>
                     <l>And put thy self to needless smart.</l>

                  <p>HAving little of this Worlds Goods to leave with you after my decease, I thought it my duty to leave to each of you a small Portion or Legacy of such Treasure as the Lord hath bestowed on me: So that I may truly say in this Case, (as <hi>Peter</hi> once) <hi>Silver and Gold have I little; yet such as I have, give I unto you,</hi> And I humbly bow my knee to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, That together with it, be would give his Blessing.</p>
                  <p>And as for my writing this little Piece of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel to you in this kind of Language, which possibly some may except against; take this account: I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a little spare time from my more serious Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, took my Pen, and began to write a Verse or two, as it were in jest, and by way of Recreation, (though I had seldom or never formerly wrote any thing in that way.) And as I was writing, I found God, as I thought, very present with me, and my spirit on a sudden made very serious, and deeply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in that thing which at first I so carelesly took in hand: So that now I had a greater work lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, than I was at all aware of when I first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan; neither could I at all decline from it, till I had perfectly waded through the same.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:152495:12"/>
                  <p> Now before I had fully ended what I was about, a sense of Death began somewhat strongly to seiz upon my heart; and withal, this was impressed upon me, That it might be very good and necessary, that I should write something by way of Instruction and Counsel, to leave both with your Mother and you. And as I had found the presence of God in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and way of writing before, so now again I found my spirit most inclinable to go on in the same, in this little piece of my Advice and Counsel unto you; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I confess for want of practice I was very raw and unskilful in it.</p>
                  <p>Again, Ʋpon farther consideration, I thought also that the matter herein contained, would stick and dwell the better upon your minds; Verse being always a friend to weak Memories.</p>
                  <p>And lastly, I thought of the president (in the Book of Acts and Monuments) of that blessed Martyr <hi>Robert Smith,</hi> who wrote his godly Instructions to his Wife and Children in this way; which you may also read at your leisure.</p>
                  <p>And thus (my Children) I have given you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count both of my ends and inducements of writing this to you, as also of the mannner and way wherein I have done it: Which I the rather thought conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to do, both that the matter it self might be the more seriously weighed by you; as also, that if any dissatisfied spirit should, by any Providence, come to read the same, they may hereby be induced to look a little, before they leap; and weigh the Case, before they pass Sentence.</p>
                  <p>I have yet another word, which is this: If you should shew this little Piece to some, they may perhaps tell you, I have been too too sharp against the
<pb facs="tcp:152495:12"/>Ministry, and that I have chalk'd you out a very narrow path in that respect to walk in. But for that, I here tell both you and them, that I know not where to abate a tittle of what I have spoken: For the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and corrupt Ministry (which especially I have here aimed at, and cautioned you against) are I am confident the very Pest of this poor Nation, and the great Obstructors of the Gospel of Christ, and those that murther thousands of poor Souls amongst us; and how can I then with the discharge of my duty to God and you, say less than I have said?</p>
                  <p>My Children, It is not the advancing the way of <hi>Independancy,</hi> nor the debasing the way of <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery</hi> (as some possibly may think) that I contend so much for; though I do judge (as you may well perceive in this little Discourse) the latter in some particulars to be much more faulty and discrepant from the Rule, than the former; especially in the way of constituting Churches, and in Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and in the business of their pretended Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, with other like things: Yet I say again, it is not these things that lie with so much weight up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Spirit; but it is this carnal and dead Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry; because they are a company of blind Guides, as our Saviour calls them: and indeed, the very Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Gospel, and all good; that neither (as he saith) <hi>enter into the Kingdom of God them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, nor suffer those that are entring.</hi> And had I but as able a Pen as some men have, I think I should lay them open to the Worlds view, a little more than yet I have done; that all might see, if God would, the great danger that their poor Souls lie in, whilst they sit down and content themselves under their Ministry.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:152495:13"/>
                  <p> Yet (my Children) whilst I thus speak, I would not have you think that I judge all the carnal Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry to lie onely amongst those of the National Way: No, no; there indeed I believe lieth the greatest bulk of them, though there be here and there a good man amongst them: But yet there are doubtless some carnal Ministers and Preachers, that want the Spirit of Christ, and the lively Word, even amongst those that are called Independants, and amongst all other distinct ways of Profession. <hi>There be Jades of all colours,</hi> if I may use that proverbial expression. And truly I must give you the same Counsel concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the one, as the other; that is, to take heed how you commit your immortal Souls to the trust and care of either of them.</p>
                  <p>For (my dear Children) 'tis the power of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and the sweet anointing of the Spirit of Grace, both in Ministers and Professors, that I would have you to prefer, before all Forms, Out-sides, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Ways of Profession; as <hi>Episcopacy, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, Independancy, Anabaptism,</hi> and such-like. And though it must needs be that some of these ways, in respect of the outside of Worship, are far worse, and more gross than the other; yet notwithstanding I would have you, if you meet with Ministers or Professors that are really Godly, and anointed with the holy Spirit, whether they be <hi>Presbyterians</hi> or <hi>Independants,</hi> to reverence them, love them, yea, and if their spirits be not too too bitter, to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them so far as fairly you may or can. And though possibly you cannot own, nor go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with them in their way in many things, because you see 'tis dark, antichristian, and erroneous, (God having not yet opened their Eyes, and enlightened
<pb facs="tcp:152495:13"/>them in these things) yet own the Men, own their Graces, own the anointing of Gods holy Spirit in them, and close with that; and take heed you do not, in disallowing that which is of man in them, disallow that which is of God also; as many, but yet foolishly and injudiciously, do.</p>
                  <p>O (my Children) I clearly see that two things in these our days are the confusion of all, and the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of all Rents and Distractions amongst the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of the Gospel:</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>I.</hi> When men are so injudicious, that if they see others wrapt up in any piece of Antichristian Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that then they think they are wholly Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, and so no kind of Christian Communion to be held with them. Alas for pity! Who is the man that can wash his hands, and say, <hi>I am clean?</hi> And if not, then by the same Rule, others that see them erre, may cast them off in like manner.</p>
                  <p>Again, I would fain ask these men this one Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, concerning those that are Godly, and yet lie in much Antichristian Darkness, as they judge, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christ Jesus hath Communion with such, or not?</hi> I suppose they cannot but say, Yea, in some measure he hath: Well then, I say who art thou that darest to cast off, and deny all Communion with them, that yet Christ himself hath Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with? I know indeed in case of evident scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, or offence given, the People of God both may and ought to withdraw, even from those that they judge Godly, and deny Communion with them for a time; us in that case, doubtless Christ himself doth no less. But I cannot yet believe that that case reacheth this, and that for these three Reasons:</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>1.</hi> Because 'tis evident to me, that many good
<pb facs="tcp:152495:14"/>men lie wrapt up in much Antichristian Darkness, not willfully, and being conscious to themselves of it, (as some doubtless are, whom God doth and will deal with accordingly) but because God hath not as yet opened their eyes, and enlightned them to see other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> Because those scandalous offences are things evident, and openly manifest to all, and so cast a foul stain and reproach upon Religion, and so provoke the Lord to jealousie the more; but 'tis not altogether so here, because in many things Antichrist hath twisted and woven so fine a Web, that it is hardly discerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the best of Saints; at least in these days, that are neither dark nor light, as the Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> speaks, <hi>Zach. 14.6, 7.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3.</hi> Because I clearly see that Christ doth not charge these kind of errors or mistakes so high, at least upon such who are not wilfully blind, and that do not even shut their eyes against the Light, (as I believe some do) as he doth in the other case of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and open scandal; by withdrawing his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and suspending his Spirit of Grace from them. And therefore let us take heed that we do not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw farther than Christ himself doth: But as we have a general Rule, That Believers in Church-Communion should onely separate from Unbelievers, and the Seed of the Woman from the Seed of the Serpent; so let us see to it, that we keep within our bounds: For truly (let me tell you my thoughts) to withdraw all Christian Communion from those men that we have sometimes judged godly, before we see that God hath utterly withdrawn his presence, and before the Spirit of Grace hath quite done breathing in them; seems to me, just as if we should leave men
<pb facs="tcp:152495:14"/>and bury them, before the breath is out of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and therefore as we commonly are careful not utterly to leave men, before their breath is gone; so let us do in this Case: Except onely when either their Spirits are so bitter and invective, that they cannot be born; or else in some eminently contagious spiritual Disease, which may be well compared to the Pox or Plague; and in such Cases I think a with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from them is not amiss.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>II.</hi> Again, There is another thing which (as I said) confounds all, and that is this; when men do out of a blind preposterous Zeal, prefer the out-side of Worship and Religion, before the inside and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of it; which we may clearly see in some men: for when they have found out, as they think, a more right way of Worship than others; they presently fall a judging and censuring all that are not in their way, as ignorant, low, and short of themselves; whereas (though it should be even so, in respect of the out-side of Worship, yet possibly) those that are so censured may have five times more of the power and life of Religion and Godliness in them, than those that censure: And the reason is, Because God doth not reveal all parts of his Mind and Worship to his People at once; but makes plain some things to one, and some to another, even as he sees cause; that so all, when they come to see their mistakes and short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, might see that they are but men, and have need of the help and advice of their Brethren, even as the Members in the natural Body have one of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: That so they might hereby be driven to walk hunsbly with God, and tenderly one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:152495:15"/>
                  <p> These things, my dear Children, I thought good a little to bint out to you; lest (whilst you endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to follow my Counsel) to avoid one Extream, you should run your selves into another, as too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do.</p>
                  <p>I have now done: The Lord, who I hope hath been my <hi>GOD</hi> hitherto, bless you abundantly, and give you plentifully of his <hi>Grace</hi> and Spirit, and the knowledge of his dear Son in your hearts; and bless the reading of this little Piece to you.</p>

                     <l>That you might clearly read and see</l>
                     <l>What once within his heart did dwell;</l>
                     <l>And taste what frame of Spirit he</l>
                     <l>Was of, for you; these Lines do tell.</l>
                     <l>Whilst I did live in perfect health,</l>
                     <l>A sense of death, I know not how,</l>
                     <l>Did on me seiz, as 'twere by stealth,</l>
                     <l>Which made my stubborn heart soon bow.</l>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:152495:16"/>
                     <l> Methought the Lord me warning give,</l>
                     <l>To be preparing for my Change;</l>
                     <l>That Death might no advantage have,</l>
                     <l>Nor I to think his coming strange.</l>
                     <l>Now what effect this Instinct had</l>
                     <l>Upon my heart, I here shall shew:</l>
                     <l>It made me fearful, and yet glad,</l>
                     <l>That to my end so near I grew.</l>
                     <l>Fearful I was, because I knew</l>
                     <l>What deadness, and a barren heart,</l>
                     <l>Had late possest me; and in view</l>
                     <l>A world of baseness up did start,</l>
                     <l>But glad I was, because I thought</l>
                     <l>That God in love did warning give</l>
                     <l>To me, to do what long I sought,</l>
                     <l>Namely, more like a Saint to live.</l>
                     <l>I thought this warning sweet would make</l>
                     <l>Me far more careful than before,</l>
                     <l>And from vain things my heart off take,</l>
                     <l>And make my mind to Heaven soar.</l>
                     <l>Thus did these Twins together strive</l>

                     <l>As if they had been things alive,</l>
                     <l>Lab'ring each other to displace.</l>
                     <l>But presently I did resolve,</l>

                     <l>Before Death should me quite dissolve,</l>
                     <l>And I this world should quite forgo.</l>
